DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted
  end

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted
  end

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted
  end

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)

DEPRECATION WARNING: You did not specify a value for the configuration option `active_support.test_order`. In Rails 5, the default value of this option will change from `:sorted` to `:random`.
To disable this warning and keep the current behavior, you can add the following line to your `config/environments/test.rb`:

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.active_support.test_order = :sorted
  end

Alternatively, you can opt into the future behavior by setting this option to `:random`. (called from test_order at /Users/pholisafatyela/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activesupport-4.2.5/lib/active_support/test_case.rb:42)
